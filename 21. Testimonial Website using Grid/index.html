                company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h3>
            <p>"I was and EMT for many yeaers before I joined the bootcamp. i've been looking to make a transition
                and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
                and found it incedibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched carrers, working
                as Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Higly recommended!</h3>
            <p>"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. Ineeded some structure from professionals
                who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encoraged to enroll by a former student
                of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not 
                disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,
                in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it durring interviews as an example of my 
                development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                multiple offers. 100% recomended!"</p>

            <h3>Awesome teching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning
                from their experiences was easy.
            </h3>
            <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress witch I find really refreshing. The program gave
                me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
                junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
                an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
